# 8 Product Design Lessons Learned: Building the Open Source Docsify-This Project

**Communicate Purpose and Value**  
Provide potential users and contributors of your open-source project its purpose and value using jargon-free language, ideally within 5 seconds

**Highlight Problems your Project Solves**  
Briefly describe the problems that your open-source project solves, and continue to update this list as the the project evolves and new information is learned.

**Provide Demo Functionality/Content**  
Make readily accessible demos or example content available to support proof of purpose or value when users are initially trying out your open-source project.

**Twin Development with Documentation**  
Actively pair the writing of documentation with the prototyping or development of new functionality for your open-source project, ideally in a highly iterative manner.

**Publicly Share Works-in-Progress**  
Share out concepts and designs of new prototypes or development of your open source project to help refine your design thinking and invite early feedback (not a replacement for usability testing).

**Maintain a Focus on First-use Experience**  
A barrier free first-time user experience can significantly impact an open-source project's uptake, even those with a more tech-savvy audience.

**Engage With Users Where They Are**  
Actively engage with the target audience of your open-source project in their preferred physical and online spaces, fostering an ongoing dialog.

**Consider Project Sustainability Up-front**  
Think about the open source project's long-term sustainability early, considering financial feasibility in addition to development efforts and ongoing maintenance.
